# Closing_Loop

Many scholars believe that learning analytics will not demonstrate real utility until it can "Close the Loop", use data to automate decision making. A common example of this system are email generators that send emails to students in response to an activity (or lack of activity). Several universities have had some success with this strategy such as George Washington University. There are an infinite number of these lopp closing activities that could be implemented and there is a lot of work to be done understanding when they are most useful.

### Twitter Setup

Step 1. Create a Twitter account at Twitter.com and register as a developer at the following link: https://developer.twitter.com/

Step 2. Register a new app (we need to create an app to access the API as that is what the primary us of the API is) at https://apps.twitter.com/

Step 3. Within R, install the packages ROAuth and twitteR

Step 4. Copy the details from Twitter App page.

I can now download Tweets (but I can only search from the previous 6-7 days). Limit the number of tweets when searching for a popular term.

### Download Tweets

Look at the data that Twitter has made available and do a quick visualization of Tweets over time.

### Setup auto-email

To set up an autogenerated email we need to install both the sendmailR and cronR packages. The cronR package is a scheduling package that connects to the cron system on the computer while sendmailR gives you access to your gmail account. 

Investigate the Chron Scheduler 

Use the scheduler to schedule an email to myself.

### Threshold Generate

Set the scheduler to send an email triggered by an activity threshold on Twitter. For example, an email is sent if a certain number of Tweets are returned by the search.
